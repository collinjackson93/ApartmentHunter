# ApartmentHunter
### Finds the perfect location for your next apartment?

Uses the [Chicago Tribune crime data API](https://github.com/newsapps/chicagocrime), along with Foursquare and Zillow.

Users answer a series of fun questions, similar to a Buzzfeed quiz. Based on their responses, the application determines their preferences for several metrics, including crime, nightlife, price, and more. It then ranks the 77 community areas of Chicago by how well they fit the user's preferences and displays them on a map of the city, with information about each.

If time permits, we will also add apartment listings to the application, so users can easily see currently available apartments in their ideal community.
